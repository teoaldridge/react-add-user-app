An exercise, in which I practiced using Jest and React Testing Library to test a simple React app.

To run locally:

- Download the project files into a local folder
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder.
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.

To run the tests:

- In terminal type 'npm run test'

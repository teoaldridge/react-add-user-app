In this exercise I practiced:

- using React Components,
- adding re-usable components,
- managing the user input state,
- adding a list component,
- managing a list of users via 'state',
- adding an error modal component.

I also practiced Testing this app with Jest and React Testing Library

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller

To run locally:

- Download the project files into a local folder
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder.
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.

To run the tests:

- In Terminal run 'npm run test'
